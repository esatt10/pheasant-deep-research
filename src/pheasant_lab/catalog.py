"""Every setting a run can be given, explained.

The console's form, its MCP tools and ``pheasant-lab settings`` all read this
one catalog, so a field is described once: what it means, what may be entered,
its range, and - for the agent roles - which model and reasoning level we
recommend. Each entry is keyed by the ``--set`` path that changes it, which is
the only way any surface changes a setting (the argv stays the whole story).

Types and defaults are *derived* from the configuration models, never typed
here: a hand-kept list of defaults is a list of what somebody believed when
they last edited it. What is written here is only what a model cannot know -
the meaning. ``tests/unit/test_catalog.py`` fails when a configurable field
has no entry, or an entry names a field that no longer exists.
